# First file upload

Here's how to get started with PolyUploader.

## Upload a file

### Upload to a specific host

The main interface lists all hosting providers supported by the software. 

Press the red **"Upload" button** in front of the host to which you wish to upload your file.

A popup window opens and you can select whether you wish to upload a file from your local files or from a URL.

If you choose to upload a **local file**, you can select your file **with the button**, or **drag and drop** it directly. 

If you choose to upload a file **from a URL**, simply enter the URL.

A link to the **Terms of Use** is provided for each host, so that you can comply with their conditions. Then press the red **"Upload "** button. 

The upload will begin and the **link created** will be displayed directly on the interface, with the option of **copying it**.

### Upload to several hosts at once

You can upload the **same file to several hosts at once**.

Press the **purple "Switch to multiple upload mode"** button on the main interface.

The individual upload buttons disappear, revealing a **check box** for each host and a **big red main "Uploader "** button. Check the desired hosts for multiple uploads and press the big red "Uploader" button at the top of the main page.

The upload will begin and the **created links** will be displayed directly on the interface, with the option of **copying them individually** or **copying them all**. You can also create a **unique sharing link**, which uploads the links to https://sourceb.in. An **indicator informs you of the upload status you're at**, so how many links have been created out of the total.

## Useful information

:::info[Info]

- Once your file has been uploaded, the **upload button is deactivated** to avoid unnecessary and polluting multiple uploads.
- You can easily **return to single upload** mode by clicking again on the purple button that has become **"Switch to single upload mode"**.
