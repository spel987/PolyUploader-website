## Explanations

PolyUploader collects minimal usage data (telemetry) to help improve the service. Only the host names and upload dates are collected, **never the full upload links**. 

This data is used to generate anonymous statistics available at [https://p-u.vercel.app/statistics](https://p-u.vercel.app/statistics).
Itâ€™s genuinely helpful for me as a developer (seeing that my software is used and works well is both motivating and rewarding).

For those who are cautious about telemetry, the PolyUploader API is fully open-source and publicly available here: https://github.com/spel987/PolyUploader-API.
