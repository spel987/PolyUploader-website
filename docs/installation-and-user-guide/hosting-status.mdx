Every 12 hours, a check is made to see **if the hosts are still online**. If this is not the case, the script makes it **unavailable**.*

## Force host status check

For various reasons, a web host **may be offline for only a few moments**. So you don't have to wait for the next check, you can **force the check**.

You can do this by clicking on the **purple "Check host status" button** at the bottom of the page.

You may be able to access a site marked as offline on the application with your browser. This is sometimes caused by **SSL certificate expiration**.
