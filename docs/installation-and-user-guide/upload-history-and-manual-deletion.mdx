A history of uploaded files is available.

The screenshots shown are from an earlier version, so the interface may have changed slightly since then.

## Upload history

To access the **upload history**, click on the **blue "Upload history" button** at the top of the page.

In this history you will find:

- Upload file link
- Upload date
- Time remaining before expiration
- A button to delete the file if proposed

_Here's an example:_

You can **simply clear the entire history** with the **red "Clear history" button** at the top of the upload history popup.

## Manual file deletion

You can **manually delete the file uploaded** to the host, provided that the host is able to delete it and offers the ability to do so. You'll find a list [here](/supported-hosts-and-capabilities).

To do this, simply click on the **red "Delete file" button** next to the links you've created, if available. The file will then be **marked as deleted**.
